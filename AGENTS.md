# Project: BTA UMS Web App

Rules for contributors/agents (Codex):
1. All changes must be made via Pull Request (no direct edits to main).
2. Keep BTA calculation logic separated from UI.
3. If BTA tables/formulas change, update tests and documentation.
4. Use clear commit messages: chore|feat|fix|docs: <message>.
